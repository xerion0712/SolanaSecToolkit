# solsec UI

A modern React-based web interface for viewing Solana smart contract security reports generated by `solsec`.

## Features

- 📊 Interactive dashboard with security metrics
- 🔍 Filterable issue list by severity
- 💡 Detailed issue cards with code snippets and suggestions
- 📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- 🎨 Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/bun
- Generated security report JSON file from `solsec`

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

### Usage

1. Generate a security report using solsec:
   ```bash
   solsec scan ./my-program --output ./results --format json
   ```

2. Start the UI development server:
   ```bash
   cd ui
   bun run dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3001 to view the dashboard

## Development

### Project Structure

```
ui/
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx          # Main React component
│   ├── main.tsx         # React entry point
│   └── index.css        # Global styles
├── public/              # Static assets
├── index.html           # HTML template
├── package.json         # Dependencies
├── vite.config.ts       # Vite configuration
└── tailwind.config.js   # Tailwind configuration
```

### Customization

The UI can be customized by:

- Modifying the color scheme in `tailwind.config.js`
- Adding new components in the `src/` directory
- Integrating with backend APIs for real-time data
- Adding authentication and user management

### Integration with solsec

In a production environment, you would:

1. Set up a web server that serves the built UI
2. Create an API endpoint that serves security report data
3. Modify `App.tsx` to fetch data from your API instead of using mock data
4. Add real-time updates and notifications

### Building for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be served by any static web server.
